# QTIWorks Deployment Configuration
# =================================
#
# You need to make a copy of this file and edit to suit how you're going to
# deploy the QTIWorks Engine. You'll need to tell your servlet container (e.g.
# Tomcat) where to find your version of this file when the QTIWorks Engine
# webapp is loading. Please see the documentation for details.
#
# Developer Note: Please don't put your own configuration in the supplied
# example/default configuration, and please don't commit your own configuration
# into the git repository!
#
# 1. Database configuration
# -------------------------
#
# Please see the installation documentation for details about database
# requirements. In all cases, you MUST specify the appropriate parameters for
# connecting to your QTIWorks Engine database.
#
# We have tested QTIWorks on PostgreSQL and MySQL, and provided examples of
# necessary parameters for them for convenience below. Uncomment and edit to
# suit.
#
# (a) PostgreSQL
#qtiworks.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
#qtiworks.jdbc.driver=org.postgresql.Driver
#qtiworks.jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql:qtiworks
#qtiworks.jdbc.username=qtiworks
#qtiworks.jdbc.password=qtiworks
#
# (b) MySQL
#qtiworks.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect
#qtiworks.jdbc.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
#qtiworks.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/qtiworks
#qtiworks.jdbc.username=qtiworks
#qtiworks.jdbc.password=qtiworks
#
# For other databases, please refer to your database's JDBC driver documentation for advice.
# You will also need to choose the appropriate "dialect" for communicating with the database,
# details can be found at:
#
# http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/4.1/devguide/en-US/html_single/#configuring-dialects

# 2. Data store configuration
# ---------------------------
#
# You need to specify where the QTIWorks Engine will store assessments, file uploads, XML
# and other data that doesn't fit well in the database.
#
# Please see the installation documentation for advice about this.
qtiworks.filesystem.base=/var/qtiworks

################################################################################

# 3. QTI Extensions
# -----------------

# Set to true to enable the MathAssess extensions
qtiworks.extensions.mathassess=false

################################################################################

# 4. Webapp configuration
# -----------------------

# Specify a name and email address for the QTIWorks Engine administrator. This name
# will advertised as the main contact for the system.
qtiworks.admin.name=David McKain
qtiworks.admin.email=david.mckain@ed.ac.uk

# The QTIWorks Engine needs to be able to send emails. Please provide the address
# of an SMTP server for doing this.
qtiworks.email.smtp.host=smtp.example.com

# The following controls are useful during development to enable/disable emails,
# or send all emails to the QTIWorks administrator instead of the intended targets.
qtiworks.email.enabled=false
qtiworks.email.devmode=false

# Please provide the base URL of this webapp *as seen from remote clients*.
# This should include the context path; but do not put a trailing '/' after this.
#
# (Remember that if your Tomcat is sitting behind a reverse proxy or gateway cache
# then you need to give the URL of the *front* end of the proxy.
qtiworks.base.url=https://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/qtiworks

# The web authentication method for "Instructor" users normally uses a simple login form.
#
# During development, you might want to bypass this and use a "fake" login that
# automatically assumes that a particular user is logged in. To enable this, uncomment
# and set the property below to the loginName of an InstructorUser who already exists
# in the database.
#qtiworks.web.authn.fake.login=loginName
